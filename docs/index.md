# **🌍 EO Course – Remote Sensing and Image Analysis in Space Technology**  

Welcome to the **Earth Observation (EO) Course**, where we explore modern techniques in remote sensing, satellite image processing, and geospatial analysis. This course focuses on **practical applications** using optical and SAR data, with an emphasis on **cloud computing and Python-based processing** instead of traditional GIS methods.  

---

## **📌 Course Overview**  
Throughout the semester, students will:  
✅ Learn **SAR and optical remote sensing** using multispectral and hyperspectral data.  
✅ Process and analyze **Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other EO datasets**.  
✅ Work with **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, Python libraries (**geemap, rasterio, xarray**), and **STAC-based EO data management**.  
✅ Develop semester projects in teams, focusing on real-world EO applications.

## **🚀 Semester Projects**  
Students will work in **teams of two** (or three if needed) on research projects. Each team must:  
🔹 Maintain a **GitHub repository** and a **GitHub Pages site** for documentation.  
🔹 Present findings at the **VIIIth Space Resources Conference** in May 2025.  
🔹 Prepare a **scientific poster** summarizing their work.  

📌 **[See project topics](projects.md)**
