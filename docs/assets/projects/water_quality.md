# **🌊 Water Quality Assessment – Dobczyckie Lake**  

## **1. Project Objective**  
This project aims to assess water quality in **Dobczyckie Lake** using Sentinel-2 data and in situ measurements.  
Key aspects include:  
✅ Monitoring **chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity, and suspended matter (TSM)**.  
✅ Correlating **satellite indices with field (buoy) measurements**.  
✅ Generating **spatial maps of water quality** over time.  

## **2. Data Sources**  
📡 **Sentinel-2** (optical) – NDWI, Chl-a, TSM, etc.
📍 **In situ measurements** – Chlorophyll, turbidity, surface temperature  
🌦 **Meteorological data** – ECMWF/ERA5 precipitation, temperature, etc.

📌 **In situ data collection is required**, either by direct measurements (using a **spectroradiometer**) or by obtaining datasets from third-party institutions (environmental agencies, research centers).  

## **3. Analysis Methods**  
🔹 **Retrieve Sentinel-2 images** and apply cloud masking  
🔹 **Extract water quality indices** and compare with field data  
🔹 **Create water quality maps** for different time periods  

## **4. Expected Outcomes**  
✅ Time-series analysis of **water quality changes**  
✅ Maps of **turbidity, chlorophyll, and other spectral indices**  
✅ Final report with **recommendations for water monitoring**
