# **🌾 Winter Wheat Monitoring – Kazimierza County (2015-Present)**  

## **1. Project Objective**  
This project will analyze **winter wheat cultivation trends** using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery.  
✅ Mapping **wheat fields and expansion trends** since 2015  
✅ Assessing **crop biomass and vegetation stress**  
✅ Correlating **yield with Sentinel-2 NDVI/EVI**  

## **2. Data Sources**  
📡 **Sentinel-1** (SAR) – Detecting vegetation density changes
📡 **Sentinel-2** (optical) – NDVI, EVI, SWIR-based biomass indices  
📍 **Agricultural statistics** – Historical yield data  
🌦 **Meteorological data** – Precipitation, drought records  

## **3. Analysis Methods**  
🔹 **Time-series analysis** of wheat growth cycles  
🔹 **Compare NDVI/EVI trends** with reported yields  
🔹 **Assess fertilization strategies vs. biomass productivity**  

📌 **In situ data collection is required**, either through **spectroradiometer-based field measurements** or via **agricultural organizations, farmer reports, and research institutions**.  

## **4. Expected Outcomes**  
✅ Year-over-year changes in **wheat cultivation area**  
✅ Insights into **biomass stress and fertilization effectiveness**  
✅ Correlation of **NDVI/EVI values with wheat yields**
