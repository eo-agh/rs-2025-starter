# **🏗️ Open-Pit Mining Detection & Monitoring**  

## **1. Project Objective**  
This project aims to detect and monitor **open-pit mining sites** using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. 

✅ Identifying **active and abandoned mining areas**.  
✅ Tracking **year-over-year excavation changes**.  
✅ Assessing **environmental impact (vegetation loss, water contamination, garbage dumps)**.  

## **2. Data Sources**  
📡 **Sentinel-2** (optical) – NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI for land cover classification  
📡 **SPOT** (VHR) – object detection
📡 **Sentinel-1** (SAR) – Surface deformation and excavation monitoring  
📍 **Mining permits database** – Validating legal vs. illegal operations  

📌 **In situ data collection is required**, either through **direct spectral measurements (spectroradiometer, drone imaging)** or via **geological institutions, mining companies, or environmental agencies**.  


## **3. Analysis Methods**  
🔹 **Compare multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images with VHR SPOT data** to detect land cover changes  
🔹 **Analyze radar backscatter variations** in mining zones  
🔹 **Generate risk assessment maps**  

## **4. Expected Outcomes**  
✅ Maps highlighting **newly excavated areas**  
✅ Detection of **unauthorized mining sites**  
✅ Environmental impact analysis of **mining expansion**
